# NAVAL DOCTRINES

ww1_navaldoctrine:0 "High Seas Fleet"
ww1_navaldoctrine_desc:0 "The waves are ruled by Dreadnoughts in today's naval warfare. These huge battleships are the centerpiece of almost every fleet. Obviously, our doctrine must reenforce the importance of these Capital Ships, and use our lighter vessels such as Cruisers as screens and support ships for the fleet."

ww1_navaldoctrine_2:0 "Naval Convoy"
ww1_navaldoctrine_2_desc:0 "Ensuring supplies are transported across the seas is an important task. Grouping up individual ships into Convoy groups will help our ships protect themselves, have a distinct chain of command, and make sure the supplies get to our shores as quickly and seamlessly as possible."

ww1_navaldoctrine_3:0 "Naval Convoy Escort"
ww1_navaldoctrine_3_desc:0 "While convoys themselves are good transportation ships, they're very weak, and easy prey for any enemy ship, especially those specifically designed as raiders. Using some of our lighter or older vessels as specific convoy escorts, designed to protect these valuable ships, will ensure that even if the dreaded Submarines show their face, our transport ships have at the very least a chance to get out in time."

ww1_navaldoctrine_4:0 "Coordinated Submarines"
ww1_navaldoctrine_4_desc:0 "Submarines are no new invention, but their use in combat is still being developed. Raiding enemy shipping seems to be where they do best, so ensuring submarine captains and crew know their role and support each other in this task could allow us to starve out our enemies outright."

ww1_navaldoctrine_5:0 "Convoy Target Focus"
ww1_navaldoctrine_5_desc:0 "Convoys are easy prey for any of our ships, and very important targets as well. Yet, as if by instinct, most of our captains prefer to fire at their escorts instead, essentially wasting time and allowing critical cargo to escape. If we drill a focus on destroying enemy cargo ships above almost all else into our doctrine, we can severely hamper our enemies' economies."

ww1_navaldoctrine_5b:0 "Capital Ship Target Focus"
ww1_navaldoctrine_5b_desc:0 "In the heat of battle, our captains are largely disorganized in fire. For the most part, inexperienced commanders will simply order their ships to fire at the nearest enemy vessel, which isn't always the most important target. Ensuring our fleet commanders know the priorities of enemy ships will ensure we spend more time in battles focusing on the prime pieces of the enemy fleet, and less time worrying about what enemy Destroyers are up to."

ww1_navaldoctrine_6:0 "Fast Fleet Move"
ww1_navaldoctrine_6_desc:0 "Sometimes, a fleet just needs to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible. Whether this is to escape a much larger enemy fleet, catch up to a smaller one, or simply ensure the maximum efficiency when redeploying, it's a common enough necessity to train our fleet for. Getting more knots out of even our capital ships is possible, with the right techniques and planning."

ww1_navaldoctrine_6b:0 "Coordinated Fleet Move"
ww1_navaldoctrine_6b_desc:0 "When preparing for battle, positioning of individual ships is typically what wins or loses an encounter between equal, or even nearly equal fleets. Ensuring capital ships don't meet their doom just by being at the wrong place at the wrong time (usually just too far from their screens) could save our nation several lives and ships in the long run."

ww1_navaldoctrine_unlock_ww2:0 "Powerful Battlefleet Raid"
ww1_navaldoctrine_unlock_ww2_desc:0 "While Submarines and Destroyers are quite capable at dealing with enemy shipping, there is most certainly value in using larger ships for this role as well. Battlecruisers in particular could blow away not only any cargo ship, but also any escorts around it, to the bottom of the sea and are more than capable of keeping pace with these vessels. Using our capital ships as convoy raiders will greatly expand our ability to stop any enemy imports."

# AIR DOCTRINES

ww1_airdoctrine:0 "Air Squadron"
ww1_airdoctrine_desc:0 "In the earliest days of air warfare, almost every encounter with enemy planes will be a simple one on one fight. However, as more and more of these flying machines join the battle, there would be a great advantage to be had in coherent groups of planes. Adopting air squadrons for our fighters will ensure that any airborne enemies will have no less than two or three pilots tracking them at any time."

ww1_airdoctrine_2:0 "Airship Bomber Training"
ww1_airdoctrine_2_desc:0 "Airships have been shown to be no good for fighting enemy aircraft, and thus must be tooled for bombing specifically. Ensuring that not just the pilot, but every crew member on one of our airships knows when and how to do things like open up the bomb bay and resupply it properly will ensure we make the most of this type of aircraft."

ww1_airdoctrine_3:0 "Bomb Sighting"
ww1_airdoctrine_3_desc:0 "While it's possible to manually determine where exactly a bomb is going to land mid-flight, it's not something you want to waste time doing. Ensuring that all of our bombing aircraft have accurate bombing sights, and that all of our bombing pilots know how to use them, will help all such aircraft hit their marks more often and quickly."

ww1_airdoctrine_4:0 "Aerial Bombs"
ww1_airdoctrine_4_desc:0 "While any old explosive will work as a bomb, we can increase the accuracy of all of our models with the Aerial Bomb design, which will let us use innovative design changes such as the impact fuse, and, perhaps more importantly, increase the potential weight of such weapons. Supplying our pilots with these new designs as well as continuing to improve the stability and blast power of these designs will lead to direct improvements in our bombing ability."

ww1_airdoctrine_5:0 "V Formation"
ww1_airdoctrine_5_desc:0 "Fighters in squadrons are more effective than those alone, but there are more advantages to be derived here. Utilizing the V-formation will help increase fuel efficiency, and ensure that in unexpected interception, every member of a wing is close enough to help out."

ww1_airdoctrine_5b:0 "Bomber Rotation"
ww1_airdoctrine_5b_desc:0 "We have organized our fighters to a large degree, but our bombers still need some work. A good start is rotation- Instead of simply assigning a group of bombers a task and flying them all out there at once, we can rotate our bombers out, sending smaller groups out more consistently to keep the pressure on enemy targets. Since not all of our bombers can hit the same target at once anyway, this will be a direct increase in their capabilities."

ww1_airdoctrine_6:0 "Basic Fighter Maneuver"
ww1_airdoctrine_6_desc:0 "Playing a large aerial game of chicken works against unarmed or inferior aircraft, but tailing an enemy aircraft, or simply attacking from a direction that no gun is facing, can save many of our pilots, strike fear into our enemies, and make air superiority and interception more of an efficient process."

ww1_airdoctrine_6b:0 "Strategic Bombing Role"
ww1_airdoctrine_6b_desc:0 "Though bombs are mostly used on the battlefield itself, there are a few obvious, but largely untapped uses. For instance, an aircraft with enough of a bomb bay capacity could destroy the factories of enemies, which would give us a large, long-term advantage. Currently, our Airships seem fit to take this role."

ww1_airdoctrine_7:0 "Boom and Zoom"
ww1_airdoctrine_7_desc:0 "As Fighter aircraft evolve to be able to take higher altitudes, an interesting tactic becomes available. A high-altitude aircraft that goes into a dive will build up much higher speed, allowing it to make a safe attack on unaware aircraft, and promptly retreat back into the sky. This will be very useful for dealing with low-flying bombers, unaware fighters, or simply doing safe strafing runs."

ww1_airdoctrine_7b:0 "Precision Bombing"
ww1_airdoctrine_7b_desc:0 "Bombing is still not an exact science, but we can make strides to improve it. By adjusting bomb bays to drop bombs more consistently centered, adopting standardized weights for specific scenarios, and training our pilots on when to drop and when to reserve their payload, we can increase the efficiency of our bomber forces further."

ww1_airdoctrine_8:0 "Turn Fighting"
ww1_airdoctrine_8_desc:0 "Fighters that are more maneuverable can quickly circle an enemy to stay in their blind spot, and keep pressure on an enemy aircraft. If nothing else, this little flying circus will buy any fighter enough time to get backup, if not confuse his enemy and get an easy exit from a fight. However, if our planes get a significant maneuverability advantage, this will be a very devestating tactic to our enemies."

ww1_airdoctrine_9:0 "Quick Bombing"
ww1_airdoctrine_9_desc:0 "In times of enemy air superiority, bombing must be a quick and dirty operation. Training our light bomber pilots in quick bomb-quick exit tactics will let them do additional damage when time is of the essence, and even in normal operation, will increase the speed at which bombers can drop their payloads and return for resupply."

ww1_airdoctrine_unlock_ww2:0 "Ace Veteran Initiative"
ww1_airdoctrine_unlock_ww2_desc:0 "Some of our finer pilots are becoming celebrities of note, and are massive inspirations to the men who work in the same air squadron. These men are very valuable in air combat, and as experts to teach their fellow pilots tricks and techniques. Making sure pilots are recognized for their efforts and able to pass on these skills will vastly help our air force."
